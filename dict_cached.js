This small to medium-sized tree has evergreen leaves and white flowers that appear in large, drooping clusters. The fruits are orange-red berries. Arbutus grows on dry, sunny, frequently rocky sites throughout the southern coast of British Columbia and the southeastern part of Vancouver Island. Cultural Role: The leaves or inner bark of arbutus may be chewed for toothache and stomach problems.
